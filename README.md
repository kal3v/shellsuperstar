# Shell Superstar

A simple, non-GUI, environment setup. A place where you spent almost all of your time. A place that feels like home.

>This is a spin of the clever [dotfiles](https://github.com/Grazfather/dotfiles) environment setup created by [Grazfather](https://github.com/Grazfather) with less vim modules and adapted for zsh and screen.
